Managing tasks efficiently is essential for productivity, and this Java-based task tracker provides a simple yet effective solution. Built with Java Swing, it allows users to add tasks with due dates, mark them as completed, and remove them when necessary. The application automatically saves tasks, ensuring that all data persists even after closing and reopening the program.

This tracker provides an intuitive interface where tasks are displayed in a list, making it easy to manage daily activities. Users can type in a task, specify a due date, and instantly see it added to their task list. When a task is completed, it can be marked accordingly, and any unnecessary tasks can be removed with a single click. The app uses Java Object Serialization to store tasks in a file, allowing seamless retrieval upon reopening.

Developing this project helped me strengthen my knowledge of Java GUI development and event-driven programming. Implementing an interactive interface using Java Swing required handling real-time user inputs, managing button actions, and dynamically updating the display. One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that tasks were saved correctly so users wouldnâ€™t lose their data upon exiting. By using file handling with object serialization, I was able to create a persistent storage system that keeps all tasks intact.
