The Valorant Weapon Comparison Tool is a Java-based desktop application designed to help players compare weapons in Valorant. Using a simple and intuitive Java Swing interface, users can select two weapons and analyze key attributes such as damage, fire rate, magazine size, and cost. The tool highlights the superior stats in each category, making it easier for players to make informed choices. Weapon data is stored in a HashMap, ensuring quick access and efficient comparisons without the need for external resources.

As the sole developer, I designed the object-oriented architecture, implemented a structured database, and developed the GUI. I created a Weapon class to encapsulate key attributes and built the WeaponDatabase to store all weapons efficiently. The comparison logic was designed to evaluate each weaponâ€™s attributes and highlight the stronger stats dynamically. Throughout development, I focused on accuracy, efficiency, and user experience, ensuring a seamless and accessible tool.

This project enhanced my skills in object-oriented programming, GUI development, and algorithmic problem-solving. It deepened my understanding of data organization, UI design, and debugging. Looking forward, potential improvements include integrating Riot Games' API for real-time updates, adding detailed damage breakdowns, and transitioning the interface to JavaFX for a more modern look
