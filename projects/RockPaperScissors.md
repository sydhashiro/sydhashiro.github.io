Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game often used to resolve conflicts or just for fun. The rules are simple:

Each player selects one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The outcome is determined by these rules:
Rock beats Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper: Scissors cut Paper.
Paper beats Rock: Paper covers Rock.
If both players choose the same, the result is a tie.
