<h1 style="color:pink;">Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314</h1>

<h2 style="color:pink;">I. Introduction</h2>

AI is everywhere now, even in classes like ICS 314, where half the battle is figuring out what a “design pattern” actually means. I’ve used tools like ChatGPT a lot this semester—sometimes as a coding buddy, sometimes as a sanity check, and sometimes just to get unstuck when nothing else was working. I also tried GitHub Copilot here and there, but mostly stuck with ChatGPT because it was easier to guide.

Throughout the course, I used AI in a bunch of different ways. I turned to it during WODs, while working on essays, learning concepts I didn’t fully get during lectures, and especially during the final project when everything hit at once. That said, I didn’t just rely on it—sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn’t. This reflection is a breakdown of how I used AI, what worked, what didn’t, and what I learned along the way.

<h2 style="color:pink;">II. Personal Experience with AI</h2>

<h3 style="color:pink;">1. Experience WODs</h3>  
For the Experience WODs, I really tried not to use AI unless I was totally stuck. Most of the time, there were walkthrough videos that explained what we needed to do, so I figured it made more sense to follow those and try it on my own first. That said, if there was something I didn’t understand, I’d ask ChatGPT to simplify it for me. I wasn’t using it to do the assignment—just to explain stuff that was unclear.

<h3 style="color:pink;">2. In-class Practice WODs</h3>  
For the in-class Practice WODs, I tried not to use AI and just relied on what we went over in the Experience WODs since the format and logic were usually pretty similar. I figured if I could get through those on my own, I’d be fine here too. That said, if I ran into a weird bug or got stuck on something, I’d sometimes ask ChatGPT for help fixing the issue or figuring out what was going wrong.

<h3 style="color:pink;">3. In-class WODs</h3>  
At the start of the semester, I made an effort to go over the Experience WODs and the in-class Practice WODs before the actual in-class WODs. It helped me feel more prepared and gave me a better shot at finishing within the time limit. But as the semester went on, I stopped doing that and just started going into them cold. When I had time afterward, I’d use AI to help me understand concepts I got wrong or to compare my code with the practice WOD solution. I’d paste both into ChatGPT and ask it to walk me through the differences, which helped me figure out how to write cleaner or more efficient code.

<h3 style="color:pink;">4. Essays</h3>  
For essays, I’d usually start by just brain-dumping my thoughts into a Google Doc without worrying about structure or grammar. Then I’d use ChatGPT to help turn that mess into something readable. It was basically like having a writing assistant that could organize everything I was trying to say. After that, I’d go back and edit the draft myself to make it sound more personal and less like a robot wrote it. My grammar’s not the best, so I definitely leaned on AI to clean things up and make sure my points came across clearly.

<h3 style="color:pink;">5. Final Project</h3>  
AI was a big help during the final project, especially when things started to feel overwhelming. I used ChatGPT to help break down tasks into smaller steps so I could focus without stressing about the bigger picture. It also helped me brainstorm different ideas and features I could add to the project. Toward the end, when I just wanted to finish things up, AI was super useful for fixing ESLint errors. I’d copy the error message and ask ChatGPT how to rewrite the code to get rid of it, which saved me a lot of time.

<h3 style="color:pink;">6. Learning a concept or tutorial</h3>  
Sometimes I’d use AI to summarize the readings from the modules, especially if I didn’t have time to go through everything in detail. It helped me get the gist of what was being explained without needing to read every single word. But for the most part, I relied more on the lecture recordings that were uploaded. Watching the videos felt more direct and easier to follow than trying to learn from long readings or having AI explain something from scratch.

<h3 style="color:pink;">7. Answering a question in class or in Discord</h3>  
I definitely used AI to help explain things I felt too embarrassed to ask out loud. Sometimes the problem was super obvious, and I just needed someone to walk me through it without judgment. ChatGPT was good for that. As for Discord, I mostly stayed quiet. I didn’t really ask or answer questions there. If I were to answer someone, I wouldn’t use AI to do it—I’d want to actually understand what I was talking about. Plus, I figure if they’re asking in Discord, it probably means AI already let them down.

<h3 style="color:pink;">8. Asking or answering a smart-question</h3>  
Sometimes I’d use AI to help me form a question or explain something I was struggling to put into words. I know what I want to say in my head, but I have a hard time explaining it clearly. So I’d type out all my thoughts and then ask ChatGPT to help summarize it or phrase it in a way that made more sense. It helped me get to the point faster and made me feel more confident about actually asking something.

<h3 style="color:pink;">9. Coding example</h3>  
I used AI a few times when I needed quick examples to understand how to implement specific features in my planner code. One example was when I was trying to render the water tracker with clickable water drops for each day. I asked ChatGPT something like, “How do I create multiple clickable icons in a grid using React and Bootstrap 5?” It gave me a simple layout using `map()` and Bootstrap classes that helped me figure out how to loop through each day and render eight drop icons per day. It didn’t match my exact design, but it got me close enough to build from.

<h3 style="color:pink;">10. Explaining code</h3>  
After finishing the Experience WODs, I tried to go back and understand what each line of code was actually doing. At first, I’d manually go through everything and reread the instructions. But as the semester went on, I started just copy-pasting the code into ChatGPT and asking it to explain what was going on. It saved me time and helped me understand the concepts faster. It was also super helpful during the final project when I hit bugs I had no clue how to fix. Sometimes I didn’t even know what the code was supposed to be doing, so getting a breakdown from AI helped a lot.

<h3 style="color:pink;">11. Writing code</h3>  
I tried to build most of my code on my own, especially during the final project. But when I ran into problems or got stuck on how to approach something, I’d ask ChatGPT for help. I didn’t rely on it to write full functions for me, but I’d use it to get ideas or figure out how to structure something I was struggling with. It helped point me in the right direction, but I still had to go in and make it work with the rest of my code.

<h3 style="color:pink;">12. Documenting code</h3>  
I tried my best to write comments here and there, but honestly, I’m pretty lazy with it. Unless it was something I knew I’d forget later or something confusing, I didn’t really go out of my way to document everything. I didn’t use AI to write comments for me either—I just kind of wrote what I felt was necessary and moved on.

<h3 style="color:pink;">13. Quality assurance</h3>  
I used AI a lot when it came to fixing ESLint errors or bugs, especially near the end of the semester when I was just trying to get everything working. I’d copy the error message into ChatGPT and ask how to fix it. I also used it to help with debugging trickier problems and checking if I was missing any edge cases. It saved me from spending hours stuck on things that turned out to have really simple fixes.

<h3 style="color:pink;">14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h3>  
Outside of writing and debugging code, I also used AI to help me organize my planner page and figure out the most efficient way to work through the project. Sometimes I’d ask it for layout suggestions or ways to make the UI cleaner. On top of that, I’d use ChatGPT to help manage my time. I’d list out all my assignments, my work schedule, and school stuff, and have it help me plan out when to work on what. It helped me stay on track or at least feel a little less overwhelmed.

<h2 style="color:pink;">III. Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>

Using AI in ICS 314 definitely affected the way I learned, both in helpful and challenging ways...
