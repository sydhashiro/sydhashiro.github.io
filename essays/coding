 Learning TypeScript: A Beginner’s Experience

TypeScript is a new tool in my programming journey. Coming from a background in Java and a little C, I found TypeScript both exciting and a bit challenging. It combines the flexibility of JavaScript with the safety of a language like Java. The big difference is that TypeScript lets you define the types of variables and functions, which makes it easier to avoid bugs before the program even runs. This is something I didn’t have in C, where errors often only show up after the program crashes.

One of the things I liked most about TypeScript is how it works well with modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and destructuring. These tools, combined with type safety, made my code clearer and easier to work with. The TypeScript compiler also saved me a lot of time by catching mistakes early, something that’s not always possible in JavaScript. For a beginner like me, it made a big difference in understanding and fixing errors quickly.

That said, TypeScript has its challenges. Setting it up with tools like tsconfig.json or using it with libraries that don’t have complete type definitions can be tricky. Sometimes, it feels like there are too many extra steps compared to Java or C. But once I got past the setup process, the benefits of TypeScript made it worth the effort.

Another part of my learning experience was trying athletic software engineering through Workouts of the Day (WODs). At first, I found these timed exercises stressful. Solving coding problems under time pressure while still learning the basics felt overwhelming. But after repeating the exercises, I started to see how useful they were. The WODs helped me think faster and made me more comfortable solving problems under pressure. They also showed me where I needed to improve, and every success felt rewarding. Over time, what started as stress turned into motivation.

TypeScript has been a great learning experience for me. It’s taught me the importance of balancing flexibility with structure when writing code. The athletic software engineering approach, though challenging, helped me develop confidence and focus. These skills go beyond programming and will help me in other areas as well.

In the end, learning TypeScript and practicing WODs taught me that stepping outside my comfort zone is where real growth happens. I’m excited to keep improving and using these skills in future projects.
