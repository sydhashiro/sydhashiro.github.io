## Learning TypeScript for the first time

Before this class, I’d never touched TypeScript. I had some experience with Java and a bit of C, so I figured it wouldn’t be *too* bad. Turns out, TypeScript is kind of a mix of both—it gives you the freedom of JavaScript, but with the structure and type safety that Java has. That structure definitely helped me avoid bugs and catch mistakes way earlier than I’m used to.

In C, stuff just crashes. In JavaScript, errors sneak around until runtime. But TypeScript? It tells you right away when something’s wrong, and that honestly saved me so much time.

## What I liked (and didn’t)

One thing I really liked was how TypeScript works with newer JavaScript features. Things like arrow functions and destructuring felt super clean, and once I got the hang of typing everything, my code started to make a lot more sense.

Setting it up, though? That was annoying. `tsconfig.json`, dealing with type definitions, and making sure everything plays nice with libraries—it was kind of a pain at first. But once I got past that, it was smooth sailing.

## WODs: stressful but actually helpful?

The Workouts of the Day (WODs) were a whole different thing. At first, they were stressful. Being timed while still learning the material felt like getting thrown into the deep end. I messed up. A lot.

But repeating the WODs helped me get faster and more confident. I started to understand where I was getting stuck and how to think through problems quicker. It was still pressure, but it became a good kind—the kind that pushes you. Every time I finished one on time, it felt like a win.

## What I’m taking with me

Learning TypeScript taught me how helpful it is to have structure in your code. It doesn’t take away creativity—it actually makes things easier to manage. And even though I didn’t love WODs at first, they made me better at solving problems under pressure, which is a skill I know I’ll use outside of just coding.

## Final thoughts

Trying something new like TypeScript (and doing it under time pressure) pushed me way outside my comfort zone. But it also showed me that’s where real growth happens. I’m glad I stuck with it, and I’m looking forward to building more stuff with these tools and skills.
